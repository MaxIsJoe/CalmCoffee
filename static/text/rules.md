To ensure that **Calm Coffee** remains operational and fosters a healthy environment for all readers and writers, all users must agree to the following sets of rules:

# Community Rules

## General Rules

**0. Be respectful to others.**  

Treat all members of the community with kindness and respect. 

Personal attacks, harassment, or hate speech will not be tolerated.

**1. No spamming or advertising.**  

Avoid posting irrelevant links or repetitive content. This includes unsolicited promotions of products, services, or websites.

__Note: Self-Promotion is allowed within reason. You may advertise your socials, funding platforms, personal websites, etc.__

.

**2. Act like an adult.**  

Engage in mature, thoughtful discussion. Avoid trolling, inflammatory comments, or behaviors that disrupt the community atmosphere.

**3. Avoid witch hunting.**  

Do not publicly call out or shame individuals. If someone is breaking the rules, report it to moderators privately rather than rallying others against them.

**4. Keep your behavior clean even outside Calm Coffee**

We do not tolerate users who bear problematic behaviors on other platforms or in real life.

## Content Guidelines

**- Do not duplicate or steal content.**  

Always submit original work or properly credit and link to sources. Plagiarism will lead to removal and potential bans.

**- Post with purpose and intent.**  

Make sure your content adds value to the community. Avoid low-effort or off-topic submissions that don't contribute to anything meaningful.

**- Label your content correctly.**  

Use appropriate tags and age ratings when posting. This helps others find your content and keeps the platform organized.

**- AI-generated content is not allowed.**  

We value authentic human expression. Submitting content created primarily by AI tools is prohibited and may result in content removal or account action.

## User Conduct

**- Only one account per user.**  

Users are expected to maintain a single identity on the platform. Multiple accounts (also known as sockpuppeting) are not allowed and will be flagged for review.

**- Bug Abuse is not allowed.** 

If you come across a broken feature that's not working as intended, please directly report it to MaxIsJoe.
