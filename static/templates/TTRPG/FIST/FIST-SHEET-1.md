## <align center>📖 Backstory</align>

<poetry>
ZERO was an up-and-coming U.S. Army Corporal who defected
when his superiors ordered him to execute POWs in Vietnam.
After escaping to the Hanoi underground and whiling away
a few years doing odd jobs (and dodging the CIA), Zero has
joined FIST, where he hopes to put his talents to good use.

## <align center>📖 Interview Script</align>

<poetry>
[ZIPPO FLICKING OPEN, LONG INHALE] There is no place for men
like us in the world. We are soldiers, killers, instruments
of war. When I wouldn't kill for them, they didn't want me
anymore — but killing is all I know. [CONTEMPLATIVE PAUSE] I
refuse to be the pawn of some nation. What a sick joke. Good
men don't follow orders. They use their heads. [AUDIO ENDS]
